# TrinityUni-AdmissionsModel
The goal of this project is to construct a classification model to determine whether an accepted applicant will decide to attend the University, based on information collected regarding the Universityâ€™s recently accepted applicants, ranging in entry term from Fall 2017, Fall 2018, Fall 2019, Fall 2020, and Fall 2021.

Note: The file that contains the admission data is proprietary data, so it has not been made public.
